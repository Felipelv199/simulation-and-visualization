# Fluid Simulation
This fluid simulation uses the python_realtime_fluidsim project, created by Guilouf.

It simulates the way fluids behave inside a 2D grid. It has two velocity behaviors that act as a force. It impacts the fluid density giving the sense of movement to it. As a user, you need to provide an input file. The description of the format of this input file comes in the following lines. With this file, you can set different densities and velocities with various behaviors inside the grid. You can also give different RGB colors on the file and several objects placed on the simulation grid.
### Dependencies
- Numpy
```
  pip install numpy
```
- Matplotlib
```
  pip install matplotlib
```
## Sources of Velocity and Density
## Velocity Fources Animation
## Simulation Color
## Objects
